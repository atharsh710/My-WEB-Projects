            <div class="content"><p class="para-gap">Hello Everyone! I am Atharsh Bodke, a 19 Year Old, who every so often loves to write Quatrains /Write-ups to engrave tons of thoughts on a piece of paper (or now-a-days online). Regarding my studies I am a Student who is fond of programming and computers and that’s the reason had this idea to create website.</p><br>
            <p>The main motive to create this website was to get that experience as a Student and also know you all better through this medium. On November 5, 2019, I started posting my Poems/Quatrains/Write-ups on <b><a href="https://instagram.com/poetic_windows/" id="link">poetic windows</b></a> by using Instagram as my sharing platform. I love the whole Experience from meeting new Poets on Instagram to learning many things from sharing my write-ups publicly.</p><br>
            <p>Something else that I also want to share is that ‘I believe in words engraved should be more simple and humble towards the reader’, I mostly express words for not putting my vocabulary but to express what I feel and love to share it with you all.</p><br>
            <p>My father often tells me about this proverb “तूच आहेस तुझ्या जीवनाचा शिल्पकार” which translate to “You are the architect of your life” is something which I always look forward to go all out and begin my day.</p><br>
            <p class="para-gap-1">Long story short, I am grateful to each one of you for choosing to spend some of your valuable time on my website and stopping by to know and listen to me and I am always there to listen to you. Have a wonderful and pleasant day :)</p>
